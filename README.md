# REST API

This project is a Go playground, where I learn the best practices of writing JSON REST API in Go.

The structure is heavily inspired by [Mat Ryer's talk on scalable API's](https://youtu.be/FkPqqakDeRY).

## Work in progress

Most of the parts are missing, but I will be adding them as I Go (pun very much intended).

## Oh no!

Did you find something horrible that any decent Gopher would immediately sniff at?

Please let me know either via email or open a pull request. I will appreaciate any and all feedback.
